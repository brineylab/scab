# SEQUENCING RUNS
# ---------------
# the name of the sequencing run can be whatever you want, but no spaces or punctuation
# that would mess up file paths (scabranger names folders by sequencing run)
#
#
# there are two ways to supply run data (at least one run is required):
#   - url: the run data will be downloaded to the project folder from the supplied URL
#   - path: path to a the Illumina run data folder
#
# NOTE: if supplying a path, it is best to use the full (absolute) path rather than
# a relative path, since relative paths will be resolved to wherever scabranger is being
# run, which may have unexpected consequences.
#
#
# there are also two ways to supply run metadata (at least one is required per run):
#   - simple_csv: path to a 10x Genomics-formatted simple CSV file for use with `cellranger mkfastq`
#   - samplesheet: path to an Illumina samplesheet
#
#
# additional options:
#   - is_compressed: set to `False` to explicitly skip decompression. By default, runs
#                    are assumed to be compressed unless they are a directory
#   - copy_to_project: set to `False` to explicitly skip copying run data to the project folder.
#                      ignored if the sequencing run is a URL, since it must be downloaded.

# SAMPLES
# -------
# for each sample, specify all library types and the associated library name
# any library type accepted by CellRanger multi can be used:
# https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/software/pipelines/latest/using/multi)
samples:
  sample1:
    Gene Expression: sample1_gex
    Antibody Capture: sample1_features
    VDJ-B: sample1_ig

# REFERENCES
# ----------
# "default" reference will be used on all samples unless otherwise specified
gex_reference:
  default: /path/to/default_transcriptome

  # paths to GEX references for different species are:
  #   * human - /references/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A

# ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
# -------------------------------
# "default" will be used unless otherwise specified
#
# don't forget that mkfastq applies to runs and multi applies to samples, so:
#   - RUN names should be used to specify additional CLI options for cellranger mkfastq,
#   - SAMPLE names should be used to specifiy additional CLI options for cellranger multi
cli_options:
  mkfastq:
    default: ""
    NS002: "--rc-i2-override=true"

  multi:
    default: ""
    sample1: "--expect-cells=5000 --no-bam=true"

# COMPRESS
# --------
# following all cellranger activities, the resulting data can
# be compressed using the configuration settings in this block
#
# if the block is empty, output data is not compressed
#
# by default, the entire project directory is compressed into its
# parent directory (unless otherwise specificied using the
# destination option)
#
# also by default, the run_data folder will be excluded
# if the run_data folder should be included, set the
# exclude_run_data option to False

# MISCELLENEOUS

uiport: 40909 # port for the cellranger UI
